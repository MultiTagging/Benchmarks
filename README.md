# Benchmarks

# Data Source
We have benefited from work published by Monika di Angelo and Gernot Salzer: <A Href="https://github.com/gsalzer/cgt">Consolidated Ground Truth (CGT) for Weaknesses of Ethereum Smart Contracts</A>
Their work provides a comprehensive reference of publicly available benchmarks for smart contract vulnerability labeled data.
# Selected Bases
